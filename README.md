# baseball-review

My website is a place where sports enthusiasts can go to get previous owners' review and opinions on baseball gear. I hope this solves the problem that many of us face: not knowing if certain products on the market are worth buying or should we avoid them.

I allow users to select from 4 categories of equipment: bats, ball, gloves and helmets. Once the user selects a category, a list of items will appear giving them the opportunity to select a specific one. Clicking on a specific one will take the user to the details page of that item. This page displays an image of the item, gives a detailed description of it, and displays previous reviews of the product. This is where the user is able to add their own review.

For this site I used several technologies we used in class. I used NodeJS as the backend server. I used the web framework Express in a MVC design. As the view component I decided to use Handlebars. Mongoose was also implemented to persist data in the Mongo database I created.

The technology I used as my "stretch technology" was Materialize. I had not used it very much throughout class, but, I used it quite a bit for this project. I learned a good deal about how it implements cards, navbars, colors, layouts, and icons. Some of the Materialize aspects I read about made their way into the project: the home page has multiple cards on the same row and also the link in the navbar. I also experimented with other aspects in Materialize that I decided not to include in the finished product.
